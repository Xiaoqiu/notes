> `PT Sans` was developed for the project "Public Types of Russian Federation." The second family of the project, PT Serif, is also available.

> The fonts are released with a libre license and can be freely redistributed: The main aim of the project is to give possibility to the people of Russia to read and write in their native languages.

> The project is dedicated to the 300 year anniversary of the civil type invented by Peter the Great in 1708–1710. It was given financial support from the Russian Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications.

> The fonts include standard Western, Central European and Cyrillic code pages, plus the characters of every title language in the Russian Federation. This makes them a unique and very important tool for modern digital communications.

> `PT Sans` is based on Russian sans serif types of the second part of the 20th century, but at the same time has distinctive features of contemporary humanistic designs. The family consists of 8 styles: 4 basic styles, 2 captions styles for small sizes, and 2 narrows styles for economic type setting.

> `PT Serif` is a transitional serif face with humanistic terminals designed for use together with PT Sans and harmonized with PT Sans on metrics, proportions, weights and design. PT Serif consists of six styles: regular and bold weights with corresponding italics form a standard computer font family for basic text setting; two caption styles (regular and italic) are for texts of small point sizes.

> `PT Mono` was developed for the special needs — for use in forms, tables, work sheets etc. Equal widths of characters are very helpful in setting complex documents, with such font you may easily calculate size of entry fields, column widths in tables and so on. One of the most important area of use is Web sites of “electronic governments“ where visitors have to fill different request forms.
Currently PT Mono consists of Regular and Bold styles.

> Designed by `Alexandra Korolkova`, `Olga Umpeleva` and `Vladimir Yefimov` and released by ParaType in 2009.
